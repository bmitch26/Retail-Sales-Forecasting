# Retail Store Sales Forecasting
Business Problem:
Understanding customer shopping patterns is crucial for optimizing inventory management and enhancing the
overall shopping experience. However, there is a lack of insights into the key factors influencing sales in
the diverse shopping malls of Istanbul. In this experiment, a data-driven approach is used to uncover patterns,
forecast sales, and identify factors that contribute significantly to the variation in sales across different
customer segments and product categories for the retail landscape of Istanbul.

Target Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate sales forecasting model for the shopping malls in Istanbul.
By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploring the provided dataset, I aim to predict future sales
based on customer demographics, product categories, and other relevant features. The ultimate objective is to
empower retailers with actionable insights that can guide decision-making, improve inventory management, and
enhance the overall shopping experience for customers.
